# OnlinePoll

This project is a rewritten version of my prior voter poll project. The previous project also used .NET Core + Entity Framework to create a web app for voting. However, it was set up incorrectly and lacked any account/login/registration business logic. I determined that using Visual Studio's scaffolding on a new project and importing the models/views/other aspects of the prior project would be more efficient than attempting to apply account logic to the existing project.

More to come.
